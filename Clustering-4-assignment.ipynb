This means that while the points within each cluster are similar to each other (intra-cluster cohesion is strong), the clustering does not capture the entire distribution of the true classes (some classes are split across multiple clusters). Let me explain this with an example:\n",

    "Example of High Homogeneity but Low Completeness:\n",
    "Imagine you have a dataset of customers with two types of products they purchased, A and B. The true classes are Class A (customers who bought product A) and Class B (customers who bought product B).\n",
    "\n",
    "Homogeneity: If a clustering algorithm forms two clusters, one with only customers who bought product A and the other with only customers who bought product B, the clustering will be highly homogeneous because each cluster contains only data points from a single true class. There’s no mixing of customers who bought product A with those who bought product B within each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low Completeness: However, if the clustering algorithm ends up splitting Class A into two clusters (one for customers who bought product A in large quantities and one for customers who bought it in small quantities), and similarly splits Class B into two separate clusters, then Completeness would be low because Class A and Class B are split across multiple clusters, and not all the points from a true class end up in the same cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It Happens:\n",
    "This can occur when:\n",
    "\n",
    "The clustering algorithm overfits or underfits the data: For instance, it may detect sub-clusters within a class but doesn’t assign all points from a single class into the same cluster, thus lowering completeness.\n",
    "Cluster boundaries are not well-defined: If the true classes overlap in some dimensions, clusters might separate into sub-clusters that don’t align well with the actual class boundaries.\n",
    "Visual Example:\n",
    "Imagine you have two classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class A: Customers who bought a combination of product A and some accessories.\n",
    "Class B: Customers who bought product B with discounts.\n",
    "When clustering, you might get:\n",

    "Cluster 1: A mix of Class A and B customers who bought product A (but with accessories).\n",
    "Cluster 2: Only Class A customers who bought product A (without accessories).\n",
    "Cluster 3: A mix of Class B customers and some Class A customers who bought product B.\n",
    "In this case, even though each individual cluster is mostly homogeneous (pure within itself in terms of product preferences), the completeness is low because customers from Class A and Class B are split across different clusters."
