As the number of features (dimensions) in the dataset increases, these issues can significantly impact the performance and effectiveness of the KNN algorithm. Here’s a detailed explanation:\n",

    "# 1. Definition and Impact\n",
    "# Curse of Dimensionality:\n",

    "# 2. Effects on KNN\n",
    "# a. Distance Metric Degradation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Effect: In high-dimensional spaces, the distance between any two data points tends to become almost similar, reducing the effectiveness of distance metrics like Euclidean distance.\n",
    "# Reason: As dimensions increase, the relative difference between the nearest and farthest neighbors decreases, making it harder to distinguish between close and distant points.\n",
    "# b. Data Sparsity\n",
    "\n",
    "# Effect: In high-dimensional spaces, data points are more likely to be spread out, leading to sparsity in the dataset.\n",

    "# volume of the space.\n",
    "# 3. Addressing the Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "# a. Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "# Definition: The process of selecting a subset of relevant features while ignoring irrelevant or redundant ones.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Definition: Techniques used to reduce the number of features while preserving as much information as possible.\n",
    "# Methods:\n",
    "# Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces dimensionality by projecting data onto principal components that explain the most variance.\n",
    "# t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): Useful for visualizing high-dimensional data by mapping it to a lower-dimensional space.\n",
    "# Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): Reduces dimensionality while preserving class separability.\n",

    "# Methods:\n",
    "# Manhattan Distance: Can sometimes be more effective than Euclidean distance in high dimensions.\n",
    "# Distance Weighting: Apply weights to distances to prioritize closer neighbors.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 1. Importance of Feature Scaling in KNN\n",
    "# a. Distance Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Effect of Scaling: KNN uses distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance, to identify the nearest neighbors. Features with larger ranges or units can disproportionately affect the distance calculations if they are not scaled.\n",
    "# Example: If one feature ranges from 1 to 1000 and another ranges from 0 to 1, the feature with the larger range will dominate the distance calculation, leading to biased results.\n",
    "# b. Equal Contribution of Features\n",
    "\n",
    "# Effect of Scaling: Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the distance computation. Without scaling, features with larger scales can overshadow those with smaller scales.\n",

    "# a. Consistency Across Data Splits\n",
    "\n",
    "# Training and Testing: Ensure that scaling is applied consistently to both training and testing data. Fit the scaler on the training data and then transform both the training and test datasets using the same scaler.\n",

    "# c. Choice of Scaling Method\n",
